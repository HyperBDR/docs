## Configure VPC & Subnet

Create VPC Network and Subnet According to TM CAE Documentation. Explanation: Establish your network based on the following disaster recovery network scenarios.

1. Intranet VPN Access:

If accessing through an intranet VPN, create a DR VPC network and place HyperBDR ECS instances in this network.

2. Disaster Recovery VPC:

Dedicated VPC network and subnet for HyperBDR disaster recovery and backup, interconnected with the on-premises IDC through VPN.

3. Business VPC:

Business VPC network and subnet used for disaster takeover and drills.

## Create HyperBDR Security Group

::: tip
HyperBDR Security Group Name: SG-HyperBDR
:::

### Create Security Group Rules

> NOTE: For Source IP range, we recommend use safe range to replace 0.0.0.0/0.
> For example, if your external ip address is 110.242.68.66, source can be configurated as 110.242.68.66/32.

| No. | Action | Type | Protocol & Port | Source | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Allow | IPv4 | TCP:22 | 0.0.0.0/0 | Permit default Linux SSH port |
| 2 | Allow | IPv4 | TCP:10443 | 0.0.0.0/0 | Permit HyperBDR web console |
| 3 | Allow | IPv4 | TCP:30443 | 0.0.0.0/0 | Permit HyperBDR Operation and maintenance management platform web console port |

## TM CAE platform account quota check

During the disaster recovery process, it is essential to ensure that the cloud account has sufficient resource quotas to support data synchronization and disaster recovery recovery. To prevent potential failure of disaster recovery due to insufficient quotas, it is necessary to perform a resource quota check before initiating the disaster recovery.

If the remaining quota in the TM CAE account is insufficient, it is necessary to clean up unnecessary resources in the account or apply for an expansion of TM CAE resource quotas.

### Source host resource inventory

Need to gather information on the computing and storage resources for the host systems awaiting disaster recovery and input the details into a table.
| Resources Type | Size |
| --- | --- |
| The total number of source host  |  |
| The total number of source host CPU |  |
| The total number of source host RAM(MB) |  |
| The total number of source host disks |  |
| The total disk capacity for source host(GB) |  |

### TM CAE account resource quota check

#### Login TM CAE

![tm-cae-platform-account-quota-check-1.png](./images/tm-cae-platform-account-quota-check-1.png)

#### View resource quotas

Access the CDN Console, click on "My Quotas" in the upper-right corner. The webpage will navigate to the "Quotas" page.

![tm-cae-platform-account-quota-check-2.png](./images/tm-cae-platform-account-quota-check-2.png)

![tm-cae-platform-account-quota-check-3.png](./images/tm-cae-platform-account-quota-check-3.png)

#### Count your TM CAE account resource quotas and calculate the remaining quota

![tm-cae-platform-account-quota-check-3.png](./images/tm-cae-platform-account-quota-check-3.png)

| Service | Resources Type | Used Quota | Total Quota | Residual Quota |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Elastic Cloud Server | ECS |  |  |  |
| Elastic Cloud Server | vCPU |  |  |  |
| Elastic Cloud Server | Memory (MB) |  |  |  |
| Image Management Service | Image |  |  |  |
| Elastic Volume Service | Disk |  |  |  |
| Elastic Volume Service | Disk capacity(GB) |  |  |  |
| Virtual Private Cloud | EIP |  |  |  |

#### Compare the remaining quota with the resources of the source hosts

Compare the resource levels of the source hosts, as per your inventory, with the remaining resource quota in your TM CAE account to assess whether it meets the requirements for disaster recovery.

**1. If you are using object storage recovery mode for DR, please refer to the following criteria.**

> **Elastic Cloud Server: ECS** Residual Quota ≥ The total number of source host  
> **Elastic Cloud Server: vCPU** Residual Quota ≥ The total number of source host CPU  
> **Elastic Cloud Server: Memory (MB)** Residual Quota ≥ The total number of source host RAM(MB)  
> **Elastic Volume Service: Disk** Residual Quota ≥ The total number of source host disks  
> **Elastic Volume Service: Disk capacity(GB)** Residual Quota ≥ The total disk capacity for source host(GB)  
> **Image Management Service: Image**  Residual Quota ≥ 2  
> **Virtual Private Cloud: EIP** Residual Quota: Satisfying the required number of public IP for the disaster recovery hosts to be restored to the TM CAE platform is sufficient.

**2. If you are using block storage recovery mode for DR, please refer to the following criteria.**

> **Elastic Cloud Server: ECS** Residual Quota ≥ The total number of source host + Number of HyperGate instances  
> **Elastic Cloud Server: vCPU** Residual Quota ≥ The total number of source host CPU + 2 * Number of HyperGate instances  
> **Elastic Cloud Server: Memory (MB)** Residual Quota ≥ The total number of source host RAM(MB) + 2048(MB) * Number of HyperGate instances  
> **Elastic Volume Service: Disk** Residual Quota ≥ 2 * Total number of source host disks + Number of HyperGate instances  
> **Elastic Volume Service: Disk capacity(GB)** Residual Quota ≥ 2 * Total disk capacity for source host(GB) + 40(GB) * Number of HyperGate instances  
> **Image Management Service: Image**  Residual Quota ≥ 2  
> **Virtual Private Cloud: EIP** Residual Quota: The quantity should satisfy the sum of the required public IP addresses for the disaster recovery hosts to be restored to the TM CAE platform, including both the number of public IP for the source hosts and the quantity of HyperGate instances.

If it is discovered that the remaining resource quota in the TM CAE account is insufficient, it is necessary to clean up unnecessary resources in the account or apply to TM CAE for an expansion of resource quotas.

### Increase quotas in your TM CAE account.

If it is discovered that the remaining resource quota in the TM CAE account is insufficient, and there are no resources to clean up in the account, you can click on "Increase Quota" to view the method for expanding the quota.

## VPN Setup

> Note: If your DR Environment is connected to the Intranet of the production site through TM CAE, you need to purchase the TM CAE VPN service and configure the TM CAE to connect to the On-perms network.

> Configure VPN. For details, see TM CAE documentation.  
> Document Link: [https://support.alphaedge.tmone.com.my/en-us/usermanual/vpn/en-us_topic_0133627788.html](https://support.alphaedge.tmone.com.my/en-us/usermanual/vpn/en-us_topic_0133627788.html)

## Create VPC Endpoint

> If your disaster recovery environment is interconnected with the production site's intranet through VPN, and the production site needs to access HyperBDR and OBS services through VPN during a disaster, then you need to purchase and configure VPC Endpoint services in TM CAE.

> You need to purchase two VPC Endpoint services, one for OBS and the other for DNS.

> Official definition: If you want to access OBS services from a local data center via VPN or Cloud Connect using an intranet method, you can achieve this by connecting through terminal endpoints to access terminal endpoint services.  
> Document Link: [https://support.alphaedge.tmone.com.my/usermanual/vpcep/vpcep_02_0301.html](https://support.alphaedge.tmone.com.my/usermanual/vpcep/vpcep_02_0301.html)

## Create VPC Peering

::: tip
Based on business requirements, choose different VPC peering configurations:  
- If there is no need for mutual access between multiple business VPCs, you only need to configure the peering connection according to the [Disaster recovery VPC connected via peering with multiple business VPC](https://docs.oneprocloud.com/userguide/poc/tmcae-pre-settings.html#disaster-recovery-vpc-connected-via-peering-with-multiple-business-vpc) setup.  
- If there is a requirement for mutual access between multiple business VPCs, then you need to configure according to the [Disaster recovery VPC peering with multiple business VPCs, as well as peering connections between multiple business VPC](https://docs.oneprocloud.com/userguide/poc/tmcae-pre-settings.html#disaster-recovery-vpc-peering-with-multiple-business-vpcs-as-well-as-peering-connections-between-multiple-business-vpc) setup.
:::

### Disaster recovery VPC connected via peering with multiple business VPC

In TM CAE Disaster Recovery, the disaster recovery host needs to be restored to the planned production business VPC. Therefore, it is necessary to configure cross VPC peer-to-peer connections in TM CAE, configure the disaster recovery VPC with the business VPC, and add peer-to-peer connection routing. Mainly used for disaster recovery, the disaster recovery VPC where HyperBDR is located can access the business VPC through the intranet to recover virtual machines for data recovery.

:::

### Test the network connectivity between the disaster recovery VPC and the business VPC

- Step1: Login to TM CAE and create an ECS test cloud server  
Create an ECS test cloud server (CentOS 7.6 operating system) on TM CAE. When configuring the network, choose the business VPC and subnet. Ensure that the security group of this newly created ECS test virtual machine has an inbound access policy allowing port 22.

- Step2: Network testing access from the disaster recovery VPC to the business VPC

Log in to the TM CAE console, access the HyperBDR ECS cloud server, and use the intranet IP to connect to the ECS host within the business VPC.

![test-the-intranet-network-connectivity-across-vpcs-1.png](./images/test-the-intranet-network-connectivity-across-vpcs-1.png)

Execute command:

```sh
