# **Sync Proxy Operations Maintenance**

## **Runtime Environment**

The agentless proxy is installed on the source host and captures data changes directly through the cloud platform's API or virtualization management interfaces (such as VMware vCenter). This enables non-intrusive data synchronization, making it suitable for virtualized environments, simplifying deployment, and reducing system resource usage.

The Linux agentless proxy is deployed on an Ubuntu 20.04 host. The recommended configuration is 4-core CPU, 8GB RAM, 200GB disk, using ext4 or xfs file systems (LVM partitions are not supported).

The system is installed in the /opt/hamal directory. The main files and directory structure are as follows:

```bash
/opt/hamal
├── docker-compose-hamal.yaml      # Docker Compose configuration for Hamal services
├── hamal-venv                     # Python source package
│   ├── bin                        # Python executables
│   ├── etc                        # Configuration files
│   ├── hamal3-changelog.txt       # Hamal version changelog
│   ├── include                    # Include directory (typically C libraries, etc.)
│   ├── lib                        # Python library files
│   ├── project_etc                # Project-specific configuration files
│   ├── pyvenv.cfg                 # Python virtual environment config
│   ├── tools                      # Tools directory
│   └── version                    # Version file for the current virtual environment
├── uninstall_hamal.sh             # Script to uninstall Hamal services
└── update_sync_proxy.sh           # Script to update the sync proxy
```

## **Service Health Status**

Agentless services run as Docker containers. Operations staff can check service status with the following command:

```plain
cd /opt/hamal
docker-compose -f docker-compose-hamal.yaml ps
```

The output will show the running status of the services. Pay attention to the `State` column:

- `Up`: Service is running normally
- `Up (healthy)`: Container is running and health check passed
- `Exit` / `Restarting`: Service is abnormal or failed to start

## **Service Start/Stop/Restart**

Operations staff can use `docker-compose` to manage the start, stop, and restart of agentless services.

* **Start service:**

  ```plain
  docker-compose -f /opt/hamal/docker-compose-hamal.yaml up -d
  ```

* **Stop service:**

  ```plain
  docker-compose -f /opt/hamal/docker-compose-hamal.yaml down
  ```

* **Restart service:**

  ```plain
  docker-compose -f /opt/hamal/docker-compose-hamal.yaml restart
  ```

## **Log Management**

All system log files are stored in the `/var/log/hamal` directory. Operations staff can check log files to monitor system status, troubleshoot issues, or provide relevant files to project managers to ensure system stability.

```plain
/var/log/hamal
├── hamal-period.log                   # Main log for Hamal scheduled tasks (about 188KB)
├── hamal-period-subprocess.log        # Subprocess log for Hamal scheduled tasks (about 10KB)
├── ip_mapping.backup                  # Backup file for IP mapping (currently empty)
├── vm-kylin_v10_Agent-<UUID>.log      # VM agent logs, can be used to determine sync status
```

### **Log Collection**

In the HyperBDR system, operations personnel can collect and download the required log files from the **“Operations > Download Logs > DR | Failback > Sync Proxy”** page according to their needs, facilitating issue troubleshooting and system monitoring.

Select the target host and click the "Collect" button in the corresponding row.

#### **Select Time Range**

In the pop-up dialog, set the time range for the logs you want to collect. After confirming, the system will automatically start collecting logs.

![](./images/downloadlogs-dr-3.png)

#### **Start Collection**

After confirming the time range, the system will automatically start collecting logs, and the log status will change to "Collecting".

![](./images/downloadlogs-dr-4.png)

#### **Download Logs**

After log collection is complete, the status will update to **"Available"**. Users can click "Click for list" to see the log files and select files to download.

## **Configuration File Management**

The main configuration file for the Linux agentless proxy is located at `/etc/hamal/hamal.conf`. This file contains all configuration information for agentless mode, including service connections, database, sync tasks, logs, S3 settings, and more.

Below are the main sections of the configuration file and their descriptions:
