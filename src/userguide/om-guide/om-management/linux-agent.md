# **Linux Agent Operations Maintenance**

## **Runtime Environment**

By deploying the Agent program on the source server, the system can capture real-time changes in the file system or block devices to achieve continuous data synchronization. This is suitable for physical servers, non-virtualized environments, or scenarios requiring more granular control.

Linux Agent supports deployment on the following Linux operating systems: CentOS 6.5+, CentOS 7.x/8.x, RHEL 6.x/7.x/8.x, SLES 11 SP1/SP3/SP4, and Ubuntu Server 12.04/14.04/16.04/18.04/20.04 (all 64-bit).

The system is installed in the /var/lib/egisplus-agent directory. The main files and directory structure are as follows:

```bash
egisplus-agent/
├── agent-sync.db              # Local sync database, stores agent sync status
├── agent-sync.db-shm          # SQLite shared memory file
├── agent-sync.db-wal          # SQLite write-ahead log file
├── collect_system_info.sh     # Script to collect system information
├── config.ini                 # Main configuration file (service address, authentication, etc.)
├── disk_uuid_map              # Mapping between disk UUID and device path
├── egisplus-agent             # Main executable (agent core)
├── egisplus_version           # Agent version information
├── fstab.bak                  # Backup of `/etc/fstab` (mount point info)
├── hw_serial                  # Host hardware serial number (for unique identification)
├── protect_type               # Protection type definition (e.g., full, incremental)
├── public_key                 # Public key for communication with the server
├── registered                 # Registration flag (usually an empty file means registered)
├── uninstall_agent.sh         # Uninstall script to clean up installation and config
├── upgrade_agent.sh           # Upgrade script for updating agent version
└── version                    # Version file, indicates current running version
```

## **Service Health Status**

After installing the Linux Agent, use the `egisplus-cli` tool for operation and management. Operations staff can use related commands to check service status and perform control operations.

Command structure:

```plain
egisplus-cli agent <subcommand>

Subcommand      Description
check           Check agent status, health or running status
clean           Clean certain caches or temporary data
cow             Copy-On-Write related operations
devices         Show or manage devices (disks, partitions, etc.)
fs              File system operations (mount, check, etc.)
log             View agent-related logs
read_rate       View or set read rate limits
version         Show `egisplus-cli` tool version
```

Example of checking agent status:

```plain
egisplus-cli agent check
```

The output shows the status check result of the `egisplus-cli` program:

```yaml
Service status
    Agent service is started: Yes.                        ##Agent service is running
    iSCSI service is started: Yes.                        ##iSCSI service is also running, indicating this node may be used for block storage or backup mounting
Agent status
    This agent is registered: Yes.                        ##This agent has been successfully registered to HyperBDR
    This agent is protected : No.                         ##No means data sync has not started yet
    Heartbeat of this agent : 305.                        ##Agent has heartbeat connection with the controller, value indicates normal connection
File system
    block       mount   fs      free    used    path
    /dev/dm-0   /       xfs     185G    4%      /dev/mapper/centos-root    ##Current system mounted disks and usage
    /dev/sda1   /boot   xfs     853M    16%     /dev/sda1                  ##Current system mounted disks and usage
```

## **Service Start/Stop/Restart**

Operations staff can use `systemd` to manage the `egisplus-agent.service` with the following commands:

* **Start service**

  ```plain
  systemctl start egisplus-agent.service
  ```

* **Stop service**

  ```plain
  systemctl stop egisplus-agent.service
  ```

* **Restart service**

  ```plain
  systemctl restart egisplus-agent.service
  ```

## **Log Management**

All system log files are stored in the /var/log/egisplus-agent directory. Operations staff can view log files to monitor system status, troubleshoot issues, or provide relevant files to project managers to ensure system stability.

```plain
egisplus-agent/
├── agent-syncer.log              # Log for sync tasks with control center/cloud
├── agent-syncer-panic.log        # Exception/crash log for sync tasks, primary for troubleshooting
├── db.log                        # Log for local state database or metadata operations
├── linux_agent.log               # Core runtime log for the main agent program, records service start, registration, scheduling, etc.
└── linux_agent.log-20250511.gz   # Rotated historical log, gzip compressed
```

### **Log Collection**

In the HyperBDR system, operations personnel can collect and download the required log files from the **“Operations > Download Logs > DR | Failback > Linux Hosts”** page according to their needs, facilitating issue troubleshooting and system monitoring.

Select the target host and click the "Collect" button in the corresponding row.

#### **Select Time Range**

In the pop-up dialog, set the time range for the logs you want to collect. After confirming, the system will automatically start collecting logs.

#### **Start Collection**

After confirming the time range, the system will automatically start collecting logs, and the log status will change to "Collecting".

#### **Download Logs**

After log collection is complete, the status will update to **"Available"**. Users can click "Click for list" to see the log files and select files to download.
