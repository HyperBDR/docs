# Troubleshooting Best Practices

## 1. Overview

This document is for product operations engineers with basic system O&M experience. It provides best practices for diagnosing common issues through product log analysis. With effective log analysis, engineers can quickly locate and resolve exceptions in production, reduce mean time to repair, and improve system stability and business continuity.

Operational issues typically fall into three areas:

* **Source-side issues**
  These are related to the configuration or runtime state of the source environment. Common cases: incorrect auth endpoint, wrong credentials, unreachable or restricted network. By analyzing logs, you can quickly find the root cause and adjust the source environment to restore normal operations.

* **Target-side issues**
  These relate to the state of the target cloud platform or its APIs. Typical exceptions: misconfigured auth, poor network planning, or insufficient resource quotas. Log analysis helps you detect such problems early so migration or DR tasks can proceed after adjustments.

* **Product issues**
  These are tied to the product services themselves or functional defects in specific scenarios. Usual actions include restarting services identified by logs or, if a product defect is confirmed, escalating to R&D for a fix.

A systematic log analysis process helps you quickly distinguish environment-caused issues from product issues, and provides data to guide optimization and iteration. In practice, log analysis is not only a troubleshooting tool—it is essential to stable operations.

## 3. How to Detect Exceptions

### Installation Exceptions

During installation, exceptions are printed directly in the SSH terminal, typically highlighted with red ERROR messages for quick attention.

### Sync/Boot and Other Exceptions

Clear error prompts are shown in the console. Click to view details and understand the exact issue.

### Alerts and Notifications

Based on your subscription policy, the system emails error logs after failures. You can then sign in to the console to investigate and remediate.

## 6. Log Analysis Method

Goal: quickly identify root causes and provide evidence for remediation. Recommended process:

* Confirm the error

  * From the UI, capture the error time and message.

  * Focus on whether there is a Request ID, Resource ID, or User ID—these are keys to locate logs.

* Find the right logs

  * Locate logs by the current execution stage. See “Logs to Check by Execution Stage”.

  * Ensure timestamps match the incident time to avoid clock-drift confusion.

* Search related logs

  * Use grep to search keywords:

  ```bash
  # -C 50 outputs 50 lines of context before/after the match
  grep -C 50 "<keyword>" <filename>
  ```

  * When you only need before/after:

  ```bash
  grep -B 50 "<keyword>" <filename>   # 50 lines before
  grep -A 50 "<keyword>" <filename>   # 50 lines after
  ```

* Trace the request path

  * Find request_id or trace_id in the logs, then search other services to build the full call chain.

  * Determine whether it is a single-service issue or a cross-service failure.

* Summarize findings

  * Extract critical log snippets.

  * Provide root-cause analysis, e.g., resource missing, network failure, insufficient permissions, and propose actions.

  * If uncertain, package logs and send them to the OnePro team for deep analysis.

### Example: Failed to attach cloud volume

#### UI Error

* When starting a host from the UI, it shows: Failed to attach

* Time: 2025-09-18 16:24:31

* Key info: volume 6ec3e693-69f7-4129-a43a-16eebe74b528

![](./images/troubleshootingbestpractices-6_loganalysismethod-1.png)

#### Log Search

* Identify logs by the current stage: Host Boot (Block Storage)

* Use grep + keyword to search the log file

```bash
grep -C 50 "volume 6ec3e693-69f7-4129-a43a-16eebe74b528" /opt/installer/production/logs/unicloud/unicloud-engine.log
```

#### Log Snippet

![](./images/troubleshootingbestpractices-6_loganalysismethod-2.png)

#### Analysis

From the keyword search:

* Nova returns 404 when calling Cinder to attach the volume.

* Root cause: The volume does not exist in Cinder, or the tenant has no access.

#### Actions

* In the target platform, verify the volume exists.

  * If the volume was deleted → ask the user to select a valid volume.

  * If it exists → check for cross-tenant access or confirm the Cinder API is healthy.

* Retry host startup

### Example: Failed to add OpenStack Agentless

#### UI Error

* When adding Agentless in the UI: The resource could not be found (HTTP 404)

![](./images/troubleshootingbestpractices-6_loganalysismethod-3.png)

#### Log Search

* Identify logs by the current stage: Installation & Registration

* Use grep + keyword to search the log file

```bash
grep -C 50 "The resource could not be found" /var/log/hamal/hamal-period.log
```

#### Log Snippet

![](./images/troubleshootingbestpractices-6_loganalysismethod-4.png)

#### Analysis

When calling the OpenStack Ceph driver (openstack_ceph_client.py), the requested resource is missing (404).

```bash
ERROR hamal.exception NotFound: The resource could not be found. (HTTP 404)
```

When requesting Keystone/Cinder/Nova APIs, a 404 is returned but not properly handled.

```bash
ERROR hamal.exception [-] Unhandled error type <class 'keystoneauth1.exceptions.http.NotFound'>
```

If the current information is insufficient to determine the root cause, contact the OnePro team for deeper analysis and support.

#### Actions

Submit the error details to the [OnePro Support Portal](https://support.oneprocloud.com/), create a ticket after sign-up/login, get assistance from the technical team, and adjust the program or configuration per their feedback.

## 7. Frontend Troubleshooting

1. Open the web UI and press F12 to open Developer Tools.

2. Use Inspect/Elements to confirm the DOM loads as expected.

3. Switch to Network, refresh the page, and observe API requests.

4. Check HTTP status codes and responses for issues (4xx/5xx or abnormal payloads).

5. If issues appear, capture request details: URL, parameters, and responses for follow-up or escalation.
