### DR Software Components

![](./images/calculatormanual-basicserviceconfiguration-7.png)

#### Cloud Sync Gateway


The cloud sync gateway is a DR software component automatically created by HyperBDR during the DR process. In block storage backup mode, it is used to receive synchronized data from source hosts.

> Note: The number of cloud sync gateways depends on the total number of disks on the source hosts and the maximum number of disks each gateway can handle. If the limit is reached, more gateways are needed. For example, if a gateway can handle 20 disks and there are 100 source hosts with one disk each, 5 gateways are needed.

| **Configuration Item**                 | **Example**               | **Specification**              | **Description**                                    |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Disk Type/Capacity**                 | General Purpose SSD /  40 | s7n.large.2 \| 2 vCPUs \| 4 GB | Automatically scales based on the number of DR host disks. It is recommended that each disk be at least 40GB. Recommended instance spec: 2 vCPUs, 4GB RAM. |
| **Recommend Cloud Sync Gateway Count** | 1                         | --                             | The system will automatically calculate the recommended number of sync gateways based on the number of DR hosts. No manual configuration required. |

#### HyperBDR Console


The HyperBDR Console is a DR software component used to manage the main DR control process (recommended disk capacity: 200GB, recommended spec: 8 vCPUs, 16GB RAM)

| **Configuration Item**   | **Example**                | **Specification**                 | **Description**                                    |
| ----------------------  | -------------------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Disk Type/Capacity**  | General Purpose SSD /  200 | s7n.2xlarge.2 \| 8 vCPUs \| 16 GB | Automatically scales based on the number of DR host disks. It is recommended that each disk be at least 40GB. Recommended instance spec: 2 vCPUs, 4GB RAM. |

### DR Software License


After selecting the service scenario, configuration parameters, and DR components, the system will dynamically calculate the required resources and recommended configuration for license estimation.

#### Cost Comparison

For example, with 20 source hosts (16 vCPUs, 64GB each), 80 disks, 6TB data, and an estimated drill duration of 10 hours, the cost comparison between block storage and object storage is as follows:

| **Item**                  | **Block Storage Cost**     | **Object Storage Cost**    | **Description**                         |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **DR Software License**   | $4900.00 (20 units, 7 mo) | $4900.00 (20 units, 7 mo) | License cost is the same, not affected by storage type. |
| **DR Software Components**| $2284.66 (5 units, 7 mo)  | $1157.66 (1 unit, 7 mo)   | Object storage component cost is much lower due to fewer components. |
| **Backup DR**             | $4,620.00                 | $5,336.11                 | Object storage backup is slightly more expensive due to different storage and access mechanisms. |
| **DR Drill**              | $179.62 (20 hosts)        | $179.62 (20 hosts)        | Drill cost is the same; storage type has little impact. |
| **DR Takeover**           | $1,796.20                 | $1,796.20                 | Takeover cost is the same; storage type has no significant impact. |


## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**How is the cost calculated when selecting multiple service scenarios?**

> The system will combine the required configuration items and resource specifications for each scenario and summarize them into a comprehensive license requirement.

**Why are there no hosts shown after I upload the template?**

> Please check if the template format is correct or if any field names have been changed by mistake.

**What is the difference between Rough Est. and Precise Est.?**

> Rough Est. gives a rough estimate based only on the number of hosts and capacity. Precise Est. calculates network, drill, takeover, and other resources for a more accurate result.


## Notes

* It is recommended to perform DR drills and takeovers during off-peak business hours.

* If you have a large number of hosts or special requirements, please use the "Import Template" method for configuration.

* The number of DR drills and takeovers will affect the license cost. Please evaluate the usage frequency reasonably.
