## Product Installation

Both HyperMotion (migration) and HyperBDR (disaster recovery) products are deployed using a unified offline installation package. The package must be downloaded in an environment with internet access, but the installation process can be completed in an isolated environment.

### 1. Prepare Deployment Environment

::: warning
If the console host is accessible via public network, for security reasons, we strongly recommend:
1. Disable password-based remote login and use key authentication instead
2. Restrict access to trusted IP addresses only
3. Enable firewall and open only necessary ports
4. Regularly update system security patches
:::

| Configuration | Specification |
|---------------|---------------|
| CPU | 8 Cores |
| Memory | 16 GiB |
| OS | Ubuntu 20.04 server 64-bit |
| System Disk | 500GB |
| Firewall | Required ports only |

::: tip
If your platform doesn't have Ubuntu 20.04 Server 64-bit image, you can download our standard image and import it to your platform.

Download link: [ubuntu-20.04-server-cloud-init-amd64.qcow2](https://downloads.oneprocloud.com/docs_images/ubuntu-20.04-server-cloud-init-amd64.qcow2)
:::

::: warning
In object storage mode, because Redis stores metadata, an 8-core 16GB setup can support up to about 10TB of protected data in production (128 snapshots, increments less than 5%). If data exceeds 10TB but is under 30TB, it’s recommended to upgrade memory to 32GB. For data between 30TB and 50TB, upgrading to 64GB is advised. If data is larger, it’s best to deploy a separate Redis node to meet memory needs.
:::

### 2. Obtain Installation Package

If the console host has direct internet access, we recommend using this method to obtain the installation package.

```sh
# Get the latest HyperBDR package URL
HYPERBDR_PACKAGE=$(curl -s -k https://install.oneprocloud.com/get_hyperbdr_latest/latest)
echo "HYPERBDR_PACKAGE: ${HYPERBDR_PACKAGE}"

# Get the corresponding MD5 file URL
HYPERBDR_PACKAGE_MD5="${HYPERBDR_PACKAGE}.md5"
echo "HYPERBDR_PACKAGE_MD5: ${HYPERBDR_PACKAGE_MD5}"

# Extract package name
HYPERBDR_PACKAGE_NAME="${HYPERBDR_PACKAGE##*/}"
echo "HYPERBDR_PACKAGE_NAME: ${HYPERBDR_PACKAGE_NAME}"

# Extract MD5 filename
HYPERBDR_PACKAGE_MD5_NAME="${HYPERBDR_PACKAGE_NAME}.md5"
echo "HYPERBDR_PACKAGE_MD5_NAME: ${HYPERBDR_PACKAGE_MD5_NAME}"

# Start download
curl -k -O "$HYPERBDR_PACKAGE"
curl -k -O "$HYPERBDR_PACKAGE_MD5"
```

#### (Optional) Offline Package Download

::: warning
Skip this step if you've already obtained the package through the online method.
:::

If the installation host cannot access the internet, you can use a browser on another device to access:

- [https://install.oneprocloud.com/get_hyperbdr_latest](https://install.oneprocloud.com/get_hyperbdr_latest)

Add `.md5` suffix to the URL to get the corresponding MD5 verification file. Then manually upload the installation package to the console host.

### 3. Verify Package Integrity (MD5)

If obtained through the online method, you can directly compare; if downloaded through a browser, you need to manually verify.

- Step 1: Generate MD5 value for the downloaded package

```sh
md5sum "$HYPERBDR_PACKAGE_NAME"
```

- Step 2: Check the MD5 value in the verification file

```sh
cat "$HYPERBDR_PACKAGE_MD5_NAME"
```

- Step 3: Compare MD5 values

If the MD5 values from Step 1 and Step 2 match, the package is intact. If they differ, try downloading again or contact our support team.

### 4. Product Installation

::: tip
Before proceeding, ensure:
1. The installation package is correctly uploaded to the target host
2. Package integrity verification is completed
3. Target host OS is Ubuntu 20.04 64-bit
4. System time is correctly synchronized
5. System firewall is properly configured
:::

- Extract the installation package

```sh
rm -rf /mnt/installer && tar -zxvf "$HYPERBDR_PACKAGE_NAME" -C /mnt/
```

#### (Method 1) Internal Network/Dedicated Line/VPN

::: warning
By default, the installation script uses the first network interface address as the platform service address.
:::

```sh
bash /mnt/installer/install.sh
```

#### (Method 2) Public Network/NAT Network

```sh
bash /mnt/installer/install.sh -i <Console Service IP>
```

::: tip
The -i parameter specifies the console's external service IP address, which is used for:
- Agent/Agentless package download
- Client-to-console communication

For example, if you specify a public IP (such as an EIP in cloud platforms), all external services will use public network addresses, including:
- Agent download links
- Source-to-Console platform communication addresses

Please carefully select the console service IP address based on your actual environment.
