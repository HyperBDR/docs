# **Host DR**

Resource Disaster Recovery is the main workflow guide page for HyperBDR disaster recovery. All DR operations are completed on this page, including both forward host DR and host failback processes.

The host DR process consists of three main steps: Select Host, Setup DR, and Start DR. You can follow these three steps to complete the full cycle from host disaster recovery to DR drill/takeover.

Click the top "DR" navigation bar, then click the left "Host DR" navigation bar to perform the main host DR workflow.

## **Operation Process**

## **Preparation**

### **Register HyperBDR User**

Before adding a disaster recovery host, make sure you have created at least one disaster recovery account on the platform. The platform is built with a multi-tenant architecture, allowing you to manage accounts and permissions independently for different teams or projects.

[Click here to learn how to create a new disaster recovery account](../register/register.md)

If you already have an account, please skip this step.

### **Add HyperBDR Product License**

Before using the disaster recovery service, you need to request a product license. Please contact your project manager or email support@oneprocloud.com to obtain a valid license.

[Click here to view the step-by-step guide for applying for a license](../../saas-license/hyperbdr)

If you have already added a license, please skip this step.

### **Complete Production Site Configuration**

This step is for agentless mode on the source production platform, including five types: VMware, OpenStack, AWS, FusionCompute, and Oracle.

* [Add VMware production site](../configuration/production-site.md#add-vmware-platform)
* [Add OpenStack production site](../configuration/production-site.md#add-openstack-platform)
* [Add AWS production site](../configuration/production-site.md#add-aws-platform)
* [Add FusionCompute production site](../configuration/production-site.md#add-fusioncompute-platform)
* [Add Oracle production site](../configuration/production-site.md#add-oracle-platform)   

If your source is in **Agent** or you have already completed the **production site configuration**, please skip this step.

### **Complete Disaster Recovery Target Configuration**

This step applies when the disaster recovery (DR) target platform has already been automated and integrated. You need to complete the **DR target configuration** in advance.

If you have not configured it yet, please first go to **(Disaster Recovery Target Platform Configuration)** to add a DR recovery platform.

If you are using object storage mode, you can skip this step.

### **Network Policy Activation**

When performing **Select Host, DR Configuration, and Start DR** steps, you must activate network access from the source production platform to the HyperBDR DR console and the DR target. This ensures the source production platform can be properly added, registered, and can synchronize data. Without this, adding hosts will fail.

* (Network architecture and policies for agentless mode)

* (Network architecture and policies for agent-based mode)

### **Plan VPC, Subnets, and Other Network Resources for the DR Target Platform**

During **DR configuration**, you need to assign target resources for the backup hosts. This requires selecting pre-planned VPCs, subnets, security groups, and other network settings. If these resources have not been created and planned ahead, subsequent steps cannot proceed.

You must ensure there is at least one usable VPC, subnet, and security group under the DR target cloud account.

This step is applicable for DR targets using automated block storage mode or object storage automated recovery mode. Other common methods can ignore this step.

## **Select Host**

Log in to the console, click the top **"DR"** navigation bar, then click **"Host DR"** on the left sidebar. Next, click the **"Select Host"** menu, and click the **"Add Host"** button to add production hosts for disaster recovery.

### **Agentless**

The source-side agentless mode supports five types of production platforms: VMware, OpenStack, AWS, FusionCompute, and Oracle.

Agentless mode requires deploying one or more Sync Proxy agents on the source side. The Sync Proxy agents centrally connect and call the source production API interfaces to obtain data, so prior network planning and configuration is necessary.

* VMware Platform Sync Proxy VM Creation

You can directly download the OVA template and import it into VMware to create a Sync Proxy VM for use.

OVA download link: [Download Here](https://hyperbdr-system-image-do-not-delete.obs.ap-southeast-3.myhuaweicloud.com/proxy-agent_BaseOS.ova)

* Sync Proxy VM Creation for Other Platforms

For other platforms, you can create a virtual machine with Ubuntu 20.04 OS. For OpenStack or other KVM virtualization platforms, you can download the standard Ubuntu 20.04 QCOW image and import it for use.

QCOW image download link: [Download Here](https://downloads.oneprocloud.com/docs_images/ubuntu-20.04-server-cloud-init-amd64.qcow2)

> Note: This Ubuntu 20.04 image has no default login password. It includes the cloud-init service inside the image, so the cloud platform you import it into must support password injection via cloud-init, otherwise this image cannot be used.

##### **Custom Pre & Post Scripts**

Custom Pre and Post Scripts can be used to assist users in executing custom scripts before and after the host is started. This is primarily used to execute commands during a reboot to ensure business continuity.

**Custom Pre-Script:**

>The pre-script runs last during the driver adaptation process.
>It works on Ubuntu 20.04 and needs to be written in Linux Bash.
>This script can change settings in your root disk.
>If you need to change data in other disks, it's better to use the post-script.
>You can access your root disk folder through $HOST_ROOT_PATH.
>For example, on Linux, $HOST_ROOT_PATH means the system root directory; on Windows, it's the C drive.
>For example, if you want to modify a program configuration file in CentOS 7, you can do it like this: sed -i 's/old_text/new_text/g' $HOST_ROOT_PATH/path/to/config/file
>For example, if you want to create a new file in Windows, you can do it like this: echo "content" >> %HOST_ROOT_PATH%\new.txt
>Note: On the AWS platform, when the operating system is Windows, the preceding script runs on Windows Server 2019 and requires execution using a .bat file.

**Custom Post-Script:**

>The post-script runs after the system starts.
>Use Bash on Linux and bat files on Windows.
>This script can handle system-related tasks flexibly, like starting or stopping services. It can also modify settings files and add entries to the Windows registry.

#### **Advanced Configuration**

This section supports user-defined script execution and driver adaptation settings, allowing for personalized adjustments and hardware compatibility tuning in complex environments. (The script field can be left blank.)

![](./images/hostdisasterrecovery-hostdisasterrecovery-53.png)

##### **Custom Pre & Post Scripts**

Custom Pre and Post Scripts can be used to assist users in executing custom scripts before and after the host is started. This is primarily used to execute commands during a reboot to ensure business continuity.

**Custom Pre-Script**

>The pre-script runs last during the driver adaptation process.
>It works on Ubuntu 20.04 and needs to be written in Linux Bash.
>This script can change settings in your root disk.
>If you need to change data in other disks, it's better to use the post-script.
>You can access your root disk folder through $HOST_ROOT_PATH.
>For example, on Linux, $HOST_ROOT_PATH means the system root directory; on Windows, it's the C drive.
>For example, if you want to modify a program configuration file in CentOS 7, you can do it like this: sed -i 's/old_text/new_text/g' $HOST_ROOT_PATH/path/to/config/file
>For example, if you want to create a new file in Windows, you can do it like this: echo "content" >> %HOST_ROOT_PATH%\new.txt
>Note: On the AWS platform, when the operating system is Windows, the preceding script runs on Windows Server 2019 and requires execution using a .bat file.

**Custom Post-Script**

>The post-script runs after the system starts.
>Use Bash on Linux and bat files on Windows.
>This script can handle system-related tasks flexibly, like starting or stopping services. It can also modify settings files and add entries to the Windows registry.


**Driver Adaptation Settings**

| Parameter        | Configuration Option    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Driver Injection | Enable Driver Injection | Applicable only when starting the host on the same virtualization platform. Skipping driver adaptation is **not recommended** as it may cause the host to fail to boot properly. Use with caution. |

After completing **Advanced Configuration**, click **“Next”**. The system will then prompt:
**Before configuring policies, already configured hosts will automatically enter the "Start Disaster Recovery" process.**
Proceed to **Associate Policy**.

#### **Associate Policy**

> Note: This configuration is optional. Leaving it unselected will not affect the normal execution of the current disaster recovery operation. You can also associate policies later through Policy Settings.

By associating policies, you can flexibly control host behaviors such as **backup**, **recovery**, and **failover**.

Before using an associated policy, you need to create the corresponding policy first. If there are no policies in the system, selection will not be available. For guidance on creating policies, please refer to:[Click here to view](../configuration/policy-settings.md)

Policies can be associated with individual hosts or applied in bulk using the batch operation feature on the interface.

### **Stop Sync**

During syncing, after the volume is prepared, you can click the “Stop Sync” button on the page to cancel the sync process.

![](./images/hostdisasterrecovery-hostdisasterrecovery-61.png)

Hosts not in syncing state or already completed sync do not support the stop sync operation.

### **Drill**

Select the disaster recovery host, click “Drill”, choose a recovery point, and restore the DR host to the target environment with one click.

![](./images/hostdisasterrecovery-hostdisasterrecovery-62.png)

![](./images/hostdisasterrecovery-hostdisasterrecovery-63.png)

The system will automatically create or start the target instance according to the pre-configured resource orchestration (compute, storage, network, etc.). Once the instance is started, you can log in to the target platform to verify configurations and perform service testing.

![](./images/hostdisasterrecovery-hostdisasterrecovery-64.png)

After recovery is complete, check whether application services, databases, and load balancing are functioning normally.

### **Takeover**

Select the **"Takeover"** function for the business host, choose the recovery snapshot point as needed, and click Confirm.

![](./images/hostdisasterrecovery-hostdisasterrecovery-65.png)

![](./images/hostdisasterrecovery-hostdisasterrecovery-66.png)
